[The Untamed Roads Of Spiti - a travelogue by Nitheesh](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kSGJMztc1_hiuDlxGljsdMV3F4qNClYa/view?usp=sharing)

In May of 2018, Phalgun and I ventured onto a five day bike ride in the Spiti valley of Himachal Pradesh, India.
Hailing from south India and first time at such a biking adventure, we had a series of unexpected, invigorating, and
breathtaking experiences. Picturesque valleys, gushing rivers, numerous water crossings, heavy off-roading;
from being stranded to helping the stranded, age-old cultures, colorful landscapes and plenty more. I’ve tried to capture
these along with some subtle details here, which I think are missed in most videos & articles online, and hope this
travelogue serves as a guide to your Spiti adventures! Here’s Phalgun’s photo album that complements this
