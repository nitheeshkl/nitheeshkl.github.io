[Himalayan Trekking Adventures - 2018 Edition]({{ site.baseurl }}/travelogues/gaumukh.pdf)

In May of 2018, Phalgun and I undertook a 7 day trek in the greater Himalayas
region of Uttarakhand to Gaumukh & Dayara Bugyal with India Hikes. With heavy
snow, avalanches, river crossing and unexpected cancellations, this trip had
plenty of drama in it. I've tried to capture some of these moements briefly in
this travelogue.
