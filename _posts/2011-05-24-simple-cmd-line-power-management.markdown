I am a cmd line user, so i spend most of my time on the terminal and its really painful to use the gui for some of the common things. Power management is one such case.

Just to put the system to sleep iâ€™ve to go to the menu and then select, suspend. Same for hibernate, or to put the battery to power save mode.

So here is the simple way to do the same tasks from the cmd line.

**pm:** power management. check out the man pages for its various options.

**pm-suspend:** suspend/sleep the system

**pm-hibernate:** hibernate the system

**pm-powersave:** set the battery to power save mode

using these commands are way more simpler than using the gui :) [provided you are cmdline user]
