[Seoul 2019 - KLN's Travelogues, Nov 2019]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/seoul-2019.html)

Eighteen months of my research and engineering work finally culminated as a
technical paper acceptance in the AutoNUE workshop at the ICCV-2019 conference.
The venue was Seoul, South Korea. It was a week long conference, so I took a
week off after the event to explore Seoul. It was my first time in the country.
I had no itinerary what so ever and had not researched anything about the city.
My office sponsored the flight journey, and accomodation for the first week and
then I was on my own. Held up with work till the day of travel, the only effort
I had put in was to book a stay at a hostel recommended by a friend I had made
during my recent Nepal travel. With a place to stay, everything else would fall
into place once I get there, I figured. And it turned out to be one heck of a
solo trip unlike any of my past experiences!

Here are some of my vivid memories from the trip.
